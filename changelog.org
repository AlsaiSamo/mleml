#+title: Changelog

* Changelog
** 0.2.0
+ Better documentation
+ Better test coverage
  Some places are left untested - builtin resources and =Pipeline= functions (because there are not enough mods for the tests.)
+ Added =Chip= trait
  =Chip= works like multiple sound-producing channels and a mixer. This trait primarily helps with supporting chip emulators.
+ Added storage for sound data
+ Reworked =Sound= type and some functions
  Previously, =Sound= was boxed, making =Rc<Sound>= have an unnecessary layer of indirection.
+ Bugfixes
  Code definitely did not work before; it may work now.
